Hey Dana type something if you can see this lol

I want to get from Pikachu to Hit Mon Lee
ERROR
Steps:

-query for pokemon: pikachu
  - it will return an object -> pikachu.abilities[0].ability.name
  - take the ability name
  - add and check it against a set of visited abilities
  Also need to trace ablities because this will be a more unique path to the destination
  - do that for each of the abilities of that pokemon to get all of the edges for that pokemon before moving onto the next pokemon
  
-query pokemon?ability=name
 - results in a list of pokemon with that ability.
 - add the first pokemon to a stack (a list of pokemon that you have visited in order
 - check if that pokemon is Hit Mon Lee if it is 
   - trace the stack so that you know the path from Pikachu to Hit Mon Lee
     - add that trace to an array.
 -make sure you haven't visited that pokemon (add it to a set and check against set)
   - if I have visited that pokemon then don't queue it.
   - otherwise enque that url
                     
                     pikachu
            /                        \
